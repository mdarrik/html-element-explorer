>Simplest #a11y advice I've ever received: the div is your last resort. Is this your main content? There's a tag for that. Is it your header? That's got a tag, too. The div isn't bad; it just doesn't mean anything. That means you certainly don't need it for something clickable!

>Assume your content has a specific meaning and try to find the tag for that meaning. If it doesn't, then the div (or span) is what you want! The div does have a place. That place is not what many tutorials would have you believe.
